            Dear everyone, <br> <br>
            Itâ€™s a great pleasure to announce the 17th WONCA World Rural Health Conference (WRHC 2020) to be held in Dhaka from 15th - 18th April 2020. This is an international event that will see delegates from around the world inspiring and exchanging ideas on the latest developments and challenges in rural family practice and rural and remote health generally.
            Primary Care & Rural Health Bangladesh (PCRHB), in recognition of its leadership and success in championing family medicine and Primary care, is proud to have been invited by the WONCA Working Party on Rural Practice to host this conference. This important conference will be held in collaboration with Wonca Rural South Asia (WORSA).
            WONCA now has 118 Member Organizations in 131 countries and territories with membership of about 500,000 family doctors and more than 90 per cent of the world's population. The WONCA Working Party on Rural Practice consists of up to 20 members with represent-actives from each of the world's regions: Europe, Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Australasia / Pacific with a vision of health for all rural people around the world.
            The conference expects 500+ national and international delegates to attend. These will include rural doctors, researchers and academics, teachers, medical students, Nurses, Health Assistant, policy makers and administrators from both the public and private sectors and Community Health Workers. It's a window of opportunity for all to know, the advances made in different rural health determinants and also a forum to discuss family medicine and its role in rural health solutions.
            You all are welcome to join this academic extravaganza, to inspire and inform and exchange experiences and to celebrate the work we do daily with our patients and their communities.
            <br><br><br>

            Best regards <br>
            Prof: Dr. Md. ZakiurRahman, <br>
            Organizing Chairman <br>
